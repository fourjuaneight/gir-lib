# Tenjin ⛩️

A simple utility that uses [promptui](https://github.com/manifoldco/promptui) and [clipboard](https://github.com/atotto/clipboard) to copy templates, snippets, and config files for commonly used Angular and React configurations, onto the current directory.

You can run `tenjin -h` for more info on how to use the app.
